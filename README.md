# Emma Roscow, PhD

Hi there 👋

I'm Emma, a machine learning engineer, data scientist and neuroscientist based in Barcelona ☀️

I'm currently a Senior Machine Learning Scientist at [EcoVadis](ecovadis.com), building tools to support the company purpose of guiding all companies toward a sustainable world via corporate sustainability evaluations. I use a variety of techniques including time series modelling, causal inference, and model explainability to improve the way our business works.


## AI for good

Take a look at some of the AI-for-good and data-for-good projects I've been involved in.

* **World Data League 2023**: my team (AI Wonder Girls) won first prize for our solution to promoting sustainable energy communities among residents of a Belgian city, using data to fight energy poverty and reduce carbon footprints. In earlier phases of the competition, we also provided solutions for understanding the biodiveristy of marine species and modelling traffic movements to reduce reliance on cars.

* **DataKind UK & Evidence for Development**: Evidence for Development is an NGO that maps data-driven "livelihood zones" to a country to improve the quality of interventions for development and disaster response. Mapping livelihood zones is very labour-intensive, so we used open-source data (remote sensing, transport and other geospatial data) to prototype an automated way to replace the first stage of this process, potentially speeding it up by a year or more per country.

* **Omdena & GPSDD**: GPSDD wanted to use open-source satellite imagery to predict the yield of several crops crucial to Senegal's food security. Limited ground-truth data was a substantial limitation, so we trained a convolutional neural network on data from similar countries with better data and fine-tuned it on Senegal, combined with a random forest predictor to predict the yield at the end of the season. Users can use the forecasts to anticipate when poor crop yields might cause food insecurity, and take appropriate action.

## Neuroscience & neuroAI

I was awarded my PhD in Neural Dynamics in 2020, and completed two postdocs in computational neuroscience. My academic interests are in how the brain uses "downtime" (sleep, and rest when otherwise not actively engaged in behaviour) to generate spontaneous activity that supports interesting cognitive phenomena such as learning, forgetting, and generalising. These are also some of the big challenges in machine learning at the moment too: while techniques that are known to work in deep neural networks can serve as hypotheses for biological computational brain function, understanding better how nature has solved such problems can inspire more efficient machine learning algorithms.

* In my PhD I used reinforcement learning models to understand how the brain "at rest" (sleeping, or quietly resting) contributes to offline learning and memory processes. I found that reward prediction errors are likely to influence which brain activity gets replayed during offline states.

* Inspired by the surprising links between reinforcement learning in brains and reinforcement learning as a branch of artificial intelligence, I also published a paper on how researchers in both fields might benefit from the advances in the other field.

I have reviewed papers for Journal of Neuroscience, NeurIPS workshop on Biological and Artificial Reinforcement Learning, PLoS Computational Biology, and Cell Reports.


## Awards & prizes

This is the immodest part. Some of these awards are now quite old, but I appreciate them because they show off some of the skills that I am most proud of: my research skills, and my ability to communicate complex topics to different audiences.
